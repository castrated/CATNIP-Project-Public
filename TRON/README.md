# TRON CATNIP Flavor

## What is this?
The TRON network dialect of CATNIP token.

## CATNIP functionality
The CATNIP token protocol is a capital functional token protocol designed purely for profit. It allows the following:

- Default absolute minimum price-per-token of $0.14 USD
- A total supply below one billion
- Half of the total supply is reserved to the creating organization
- The remaining supply is tradable
- Whaling is encouraged for voting reasons
- Voting takes place at the beginning of every quarter, with randomly generated price choices
- There are four price choices that may be voted upon, with one "outlier" price
- Each vote will burn 100 tokens
- Once a majority vote on a price choice is achieved, there is a four-hour grace period before the price changed to the voted price
- During the grace period, tokens may be sold or bought depending on trade conditions
- The price will reset to the default price at the beginning of the first quarter, no matter what
- Each quarter, the tradable supply will be burned and re-minted, even if it is currently held by tokenholders
- The funds collected by the creating organizations at the end of each quarter will be pocketed by them, providing 50% or more is donated to an approved cat-helping charity
- CATNIP must work on at least two network protocols (i.e. TRX and ETH)
